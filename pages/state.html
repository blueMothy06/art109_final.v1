        <p>
            I probably should explain.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project was meant to bring attention to dark UX techniques which
            coerce and exploits the users into engaging with a product. With apps
            and websites everywhere you turn, it makes sense that there's some
            bad eggs here and there. Ads that guilt the user into buying a product,
            'X' buttons lost in outer space, and for some reason, your shopping cart
            is just getting more and more expensive despite you not clicking on
            anything else...
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyway, this project is not at that point to take a critical look at
            those problems. One day it will, but not at this stage with the time
            restraints.
            <br>
            <br>
            What this project is right now is essentially me going crazy and having
            fun with it. Commerialized anglerfish that are manufactured in factories?
            Now, that's an idea I can get behind! It's all in good fun and seeing how
            much I can do with my current knowledge of design.
