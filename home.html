      <h1>Anglerfish Inc.</h1>
      <h2>Where the mysteries of the deep seas come to <i>you</i>.</h2>
      <p>
        We are a small and humble company with branches all over the world.
        For every purchase someone makes, an anglerfish finds a new home. In your home.
        Because that is exactly the purchase you made.
        <br>
        <br>
        We pride ourselves on helping as many anglerfish as we can, ever since the great '20
        incident where the last corporate leader had created a surplus of them. Despite it all,
        we are overwhelmingly understaffed and grateful for our hardworking workers who
        have shed their pasts and families just to work here.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our company dream is so every family in the world has an anglerfish (and it's not because
        we have more fish than we can handle!) because every family deserves the change to feel
        the love and compassion that an animal who lures its prey can give you.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Long, long ago back in 2019, our founder, the ellusive C. Luong (who refuses to show her face to
        this day and we're still not quite sure whether she's just an urban legend or not), created this company
        as a way to expand on her horizons. She suggested the idea of creating anglerfish for everyone and at first,
        everyone hated that idea. They said, "Aren't angler fish already real and aren't they spelled as two words?"
        in which she replied, "Yes, industrializing all of this sounds like an excellent idea."
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus, began the tireless work she put into her dream, until Anglerfish Inc. is what it is today. C. Luong
        is long gone (in Hawaii) but her work still remain with us.
